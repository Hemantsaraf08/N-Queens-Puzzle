when height is given to a container ex: <div> if the content is not fitting inside the container height; we must use
overflow: auto (in css) so that a scroll bar (vertical) is attached to the <div>, to control width; you can use 
        word-break: break-all; //when div contains text;

when property: contenteditable: true, is used on <div> IT BEHAVES LIKE AN INPUT target
Similarlly: when readonly property is applied on an <input> tag it behaves like a <div> tag

calc() is used to calculate and set values in CSS styles: ex: height/width to fit a container,  when position: absolute to set left and top

for children of flexbox use min-width(in case of justify) min-height(in case of align) 
because otherwise width/height is overridden (even if values are given in pixels) to fit the container's width or height, but we dont want that, 
so we use min-width/height, and use overflow: auto in parent, later scroll bar can be made invisible

display: flex must be used on every parent, not just ancestor or grand parent node

INPUT tag is inline block type element, therefore we can specify there width and height, by default flex directn is row (as they are inline)
